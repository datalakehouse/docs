# What is a Data Catalog?

A Data Catalog, also known as a Metadata Dictionary, or a Data Glossary, is a system which provides your data workers and business analytics users with a reference to the meaning of the data that is used.

This usage can vary by discipline or domain area for how the data is used, processed, or otherwise consumed.

DataLakeHouse.io believes a Data Catalog should not be limited to access by only a few. But rather a democratized tool in the organization's data management tool box where collaborative understanding of the data can be made.

Accessing the Data Catalog in DataLakeHouse is done through the dashboard and provided to all users with a minimal "READ" user access.
