# What is Usage-Based Pricing?

Software buying has evolved. Long gone are the days of executives choosing software for their employees based on IT compatibility or KPIs.

Employees now find their preferred software products and start using them, usually for free. Then they tell their boss what to buy.

This is why we’re seeing SaaS pricing models evolve and more and more SaaS companies—**DataLakeHouse.io**, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, and Stripe, to name a few—finding success with product led growth paired with usage-based pricing.

## What is Usage-Based Pricing

Usage-based pricing allows customers to pay for products according to how much they use or consume it. This approach is starting to replace more common subscription- and seat-based pricing models, especially when it comes to SaaS products.

The usage-based pricing model allows a customer to start at a low cost, attracting more customers to get started while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time because the price is directly tied with the value a customer receives.

Since you aren’t limiting the number of users who can access your software, your customers are able to find new use cases—which leads to more long-term success and higher lifetime value. We’ve seen as much as a 12x ratio in the number of users in an account for usage-based software companies relative to their seat-based peers.
