# Getting Started in DataLakeHouse.io

The first few steps are as easy as 1..2..3:
1. [Connect your Target/Destination Warehouse](first-steps/connect-your-target.md) 
1. [Connect your Source System Data](first-steps/connect-your-source.md)
1. [Create a 'Sync Bridge' pipeline and run it!](first-steps/create-a-sync-bridge.md)
5. Get a cup of coffee/tea, and wait for your first sync completion email

A slightly more advanced user approach...

1. Create a New Project or Use the default Project
2. Connect to your target/destination Warehouse (ex: Snowflake)
3. Connect to your application or database source
4. Create your first Sync Bridge data pipeline
5. Get a cup of coffee/tea, and wait for your first sync completion email
