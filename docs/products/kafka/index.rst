DLH for Apache Kafka
======================

What is DLH for Apache Kafka?
-------------------------------

DLH for Apache Kafka is a fully managed **distributed data streaming platform**, deployable in the cloud of your choice. Apache Kafka is an open source data streaming platform, ideal for event-driven applications, near-real-time data transfer and pipelines, stream analytics, and many more applications where a lot of data needs to move between applications in a speedy manner.

Kafka stores a potentially large number of records, each contains a small amount of data, usually for a limited period of time. The storage is organised into "topics" and "partitions" so that many data streams can be handled at once, regardless of how much data is flowing into or out of your DLH for Apache Kafka service.


Why Apache Kafka?
-----------------

Apache Kafka itself is technically a distributed log storage mechanism; in reality it is a best-in-class, highly-available data streaming solution. Oh, and it just happens to have an incredibly rich ecosystem of open source tooling that connects to and extends the existing platform.
