Access PgBouncer statistics
===========================

PgBouncer is used at DLH for :doc:`../concepts/pg-connection-pooling`.

Get PgBouncer URL
------------------

PgBouncer URL can be seen under **Pools** in the PostgreSQL service web interface. Alternatively it can be extracted via :doc:`DLH Command Line interface<../../../tools/cli>`, using `pg <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ to parse the JSON response.

Execute the following command replacing the ``INSTANCE_NAME`` parameter with the name of your instance::

    avn service get INSTANCE_NAME --json | jq -r '.connection_info.pgbouncer'

The output will be similar to the below::

    postgres://avnadmin:xxxxxxxxxxx@demo-pg-dev-advocates.DLHcloud.com:13040/pgbouncer?sslmode=require

Connect to PgBouncer
--------------------

Connect to PgBouncer using the URL extracted above and show the statistics with::

    pgbouncer=# SHOW STATS;

Depending on the load of your database, the output will be similar to::

    database  | total_xact_count | total_query_count | total_received | total_sent | total_xact_time | total_query_time | total_wait_time | avg_xact_count | avg_query_count | avg_recv | avg_sent | avg_xact_time | avg_query_time | avg_wait_time
    -----------+------------------+-------------------+----------------+------------+-----------------+------------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------------+----------+----------+---------------+----------------+---------------
    pgbouncer |                1 |                 1 |              0 |          0 |               0 |                0 |               0 |              0 |               0 |        0 |        0 |             0 |              0 |             0
    (1 row)


.. Tip::
    Run ``SHOW HELP`` to see all available commands. Only read-only access is available, as PgBouncer pools are automatically managed by DLH.
