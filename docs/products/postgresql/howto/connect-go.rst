Connect with Go
---------------

This example connects to PostgreSQL service from Go, making use of the ``pg`` library.

Variables
'''''''''

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

==================      =============================================================
Variable                Description
==================      =============================================================
``POSTGRESQL_URI``      URL for PostgreSQL connection, from the service overview page
==================      =============================================================

Pre-requisites
''''''''''''''

For this example you will need:

* The Go ``pq`` library::

    go get github.com/lib/pq

* :doc:`/docs/platform/howto/download-ca-cert` from the service overview page, this example assumes it is in a local file called ``ca.pem``.


Code
''''

Add the following to ``main.go`` and replace the placeholder with the PostgreSQL URI:

.. literalinclude:: /code/products/postgresql/connect.go

This code creates a PostgreSQL client and opens a connection to the database. Then runs a query checking the database version and prints the response

.. note::
   This example replaces the query string parameter to specify ``sslmode=verify-ca`` to make sure that the SSL certificate is verified, and adds the location of the cert.

To run the code::

    go run main.go

If the script runs successfully, the outputs should be the PostgreSQL version running in your service like::

    Version: PostgreSQL 13.3 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc, a 68c5366192 p 6520304dc1, 64-bit
