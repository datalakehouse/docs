Write data to M3DB with PHP
---------------------------

This example writes some data to an M3DB service from PHP, making use of the InfluxDB library.

Variables
'''''''''

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

=================       =======================================================
Variable                Description
=================       =======================================================
``SERVICE_HOST``        Service hostname, found on the service overview page
``SERVICE_PORT``        Service port number, found on the service overview page
``AVNADMIN_PASS``       Password for the default ``avnadmin`` user
=================       =======================================================

Pre-requisites
''''''''''''''

For this example you will need:

1. The PHP InfluxDB library. You can install this with ``composer``::

    composer require influxdata/influxdb-client-php


.. note::

    M3DB supports InfluxDB (v1) protocol so we can use the existing library for this database too.

Code
''''

Add the following to ``index.php`` and replace the placeholders with values for your project:

.. literalinclude:: /code/products/m3db/write.php
    :language: php

This code creates an InfluxDBClient and connects to the Influx-literate endpoint on the M3DB. Then the code constructs the expected data format, and writes it to the client.

To run the code::

    php -f index.php

If the script outputs ``bool(true)`` then there is data in your M3DB. If you'd like to you can take a look at :doc:`grafana` to see how to inspect your data with Grafana.
