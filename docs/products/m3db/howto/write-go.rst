Write data to M3DB with Go
--------------------------

This example writes some data to an M3DB service from Go, making use of the Prometheus write features.

Variables
'''''''''

These are the placeholders you will need to replace in the code sample:

==================      ==========================================================
Variable                Description
==================      ==========================================================
``PROM_WRITE_URL``      URL for Prometheus writes, from the service overview page
==================      ==========================================================

Pre-requisites
''''''''''''''

For this example you will need:

1. The Prometheus client for Go::

    go get -u github.com/m3db/prometheus_remote_client_golang/promremote

 

Code
''''

Add the following to ``main.go`` and replace the ``PROM_WRITE_URL`` placeholder:

.. literalinclude:: /code/products/m3db/write.go

Since M3DB also supports Prometheus-style writes, this code sets up a Prometheus client and then constructs the expected data format to send to M3DB.

To run the code::

    go run main.go

If the script outputs ``Status code: 200`` then there is data in your M3DB. If you'd like to you can take a look at :doc:`grafana` to see how to inspect your data with Grafana.
