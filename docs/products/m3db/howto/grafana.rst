Visualize M3DB data with Grafana
================================

Since M3DB is best for time series data, consisting of many individual metrics, then it's nicer to visualise the data than try to view it in a table or log. Luckily, datalakehouse can set up the Grafana and the integration between the two services for you.

Integrate M3DB and Grafana
--------------------------

1. On the service overview page for your M3DB service, go to "Manage Integrations" and choose the "Dashboard" option.

2. Choose either a new or existing service.

   - A new service will ask you to select the cloud, region and plan to use. You should also give your service a name. The service overview page shows the nodes rebuilding, and then indicates when they are ready.
   - If you're already using Grafana on datalakehouse, you can integrate your M3DB as a data source for that existing Grafana.

3. On the service overview page for your Grafana service, click the "Service URI" link. The username and password for your Grafana service is also available on the service overview page.

Now your Grafana service is connected to M3DB as a data source and you can go ahead and visualise your data.

Visualizing M3DB data in Grafana
--------------------------------

In Grafana, create a new dashboard and add a panel to it.

The datasource dropdown shows ``--Grafana--`` by default, but your M3DB service will be listed here with a Prometheus logo. Prometheus is managing the communication between M3DB and Grafana.

With your M3DB service selected, the "Query" section will show the metrics from the database in its dropdown.

.. tip::
   If no metrics are shown, check that there is data in the database

Once you are happy with your panel, give it a title and click "Save" in the top right hand corner.
