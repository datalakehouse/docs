Aiven Operator for Kubernetes
=============================

Aiven Operator for Kubernetes allows users to manage Aiven services through the Kubernetes API by using `Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/>`_.

.. note::
    Only Aiven for PostgreSQL and Aiven for Apache Kafka are supported at this time.

    Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. `Kubernetes website <https://kubernetes.io/>`_.

Getting started
---------------

Take your first steps by configuring the Aiven Operator and deploying a PostgreSQL database.

Requirements
''''''''''''

Access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can run the operator. To try it out locally, we recommend using `kind <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/>`_. You can install it by following their `official documentation <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation>`_.

We will be installing the operator with `Helm <https://helm.sh/>`_. Follow their `official instructions <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`_ to install it if you don't have it already.

You'll also need an Aiven account. If you don't have one yet, `sign up for Aiven <https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=devportal&utm_campaign=k8s-operator&utm_content=post>`_ (and enjoy a free trial for new accounts). Once you have your account set, please generate and note down the :doc:`authentication token </docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token>` and your project name, they will be used to authenticate the Kubernetes operator with Aiven's API.

Install the operator
''''''''''''''''''''

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster and an Aiven authentication token, we can proceed to install the operator.

Install the ``cert-manager`` with the command below. It is used to manage the webhook TLS certificates used by our operator.

.. Tip::

    You can use the operator without ``cert-manager`` and the admission webhooks, skip this step and move on to the Helm chart section.

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml

Verify the ``cert-manager`` installation by checking if their pods are up and running:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl get pod -n cert-manager

When you see pods in the list with their status showing "Running", then you are ready to proceed.

Add the `Aiven Helm chart repository <https://github.com/aiven/aiven-charts/>`_ and update your local Helm information:

.. code:: bash

  helm repo add aiven https://aiven.github.io/aiven-charts
  helm repo update

Now let's install the CRDs and then the operator itself:

.. code:: bash

    helm install aiven-operator-crds aiven/aiven-operator-crds
    helm install aiven-operator aiven/aiven-operator

.. Tip::
    You can use ``helm install aiven-operator aiven/aiven-operator --set webhooks.enabled=false`` to disable the admission webhooks.

Verify the installation by making sure the operator pod is running with the `get pod` command:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aiven-operator

If your pod is listed with status "Running" then all is well.

Authenticating
''''''''''''''
Before creating a service, we need to authenticate the operator with Aiven's API. To do so, create the Kubernetes secret with the command below, substituting the ``<your-token-here>`` with the authentication token generated in the "Requirements" section above.

.. code:: bash

    kubectl create secret generic aiven-token --from-literal=token="<your-token-here>"

Deploying Aiven for PostgreSQL
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It's showtime! Let's create an Aiven for PostgreSQL service using the Custom Resource provided by the operator. Create a file named ``pg-sample.yaml`` with the content below, substituting the ``<your-project-name>`` with your Aiven project name. Take a look at the commented lines to understand better what each field represents.

.. code:: yaml

    apiVersion: aiven.io/v1alpha1
    kind: PostgreSQL
    metadata:
      name: pg-sample
    spec:
    
      # gets the authentication token from the `aiven-token` secret
      authSecretRef:
        name: aiven-token
        key: token
    
      # outputs the PostgreSQL connection on the `pg-connection` secret
      connInfoSecretTarget:
        name: pg-connection
    
      # add your Project name here
      project: <your-project-name> 
    
      # cloud provider and plan of your choice
      # you can check all of the possibilities here https://aiven.io/pricing
      cloudName: google-europe-west1
      plan: startup-4
    
      # general Aiven configuration
      maintenanceWindowDow: friday
      maintenanceWindowTime: 23:00:00
    
      # specific PostgreSQL configuration
      userConfig:
        pg_version: '11'

Apply the resource with the command below:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f pg-sample.yaml

You can verify the status of your service with the following command.

.. code:: bash

    kubectl get postgresqls.aiven.io pg-sample

Check the output of the command for your service; once the ``STATE`` field has the value ``RUNNING``, it is ready to use. 


Using the service
'''''''''''''''''

Once the service is up and running (you can see your database in the Aiven web console as well at this point) let's deploy a pod to test the connection to PostgreSQL from Kubernetes.

Create a file named ``pod-psql.yaml`` with the content below:

.. code:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: psql-test-connection
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - image: postgres:11-alpine
          name: postgres
          command: ['psql', '$(DATABASE_URI)', '-c', 'SELECT version();']
          
          # the pg-connection secret becomes environment variables 
          envFrom:
          - secretRef:
              name: pg-connection

The connection information – in this case, the PostgreSQL service URI – is automatically created by the operator within a Kubernetes secret named after the value from the ``connInfoSecretTarget.name`` field.

Go ahead and run ``apply`` to create the pod and test the connection:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl apply -f pod-psql.yaml

It will run, output the PostgreSQL version and terminate. We can see the logs with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl logs psql-test-connection

Well done, you have an Aiven for PostgreSQL service deployed through Kubernetes.

Clean up
''''''''

To destroy the resources created, execute the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    kubectl delete pod psql-test-connection
    kubectl delete postgresqls.aiven.io pg-sample

To remove the operator and ``cert-manager`` (if installed), use the following:

.. code:: bash

    helm uninstall aiven-operator
    helm uninstall aiven-operator-crds
    kubectl delete -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
