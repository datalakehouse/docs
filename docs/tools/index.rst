datalakehouse tools
===========

We provide the tools you need to do your work, your way. 

The datalakehouse `web console <https://console.datalakehouse.io>`_ is the friendliest way to get started and to explore something new or get an easy overview of what's happening with your datalakehouse account.

The ``avn`` :doc:`command-line tool <cli>` brings datalakehouse features to your terminal.

For programmatic integrations, the :doc:`datalakehouse API <api/index>` provides an interface you can use. This public-facing API also powers our own web interface so everything you need is supported.

The :doc:`terraform` gives orchestration features for infrastructure-as-code projects.

The :doc:`kubernetes` adds orchestration of your datalakehouse services to your existing Kubernetes cluster.
