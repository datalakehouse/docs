datalakehouse CLI
=========

datalakehouse offers an installable CLI (command line interface) tool. You can find it `on GitHub <https://github.com/datalakehouse/datalakehouse-client>`_.

Getting started
---------------

The ``avn`` client is an ideal way to use datalakehouse's services in a scriptable way. This tool accesses the same API that powers the web console.

Install
'''''''

The ``avn`` utility is a Python package, so you can install using ``pip``::

    pip install datalakehouse-client

Check your install by running ``avn`` and looking for usage output.


Authenticate
''''''''''''

There are two options for authenticating. The first is to use your username, and then enter your password when prompted::

  avn user login <you@example.com>

You can also use an access token (this is the recommended route if you use SSO), with a command like::

  avn user login <you@example.com> --token

This command will prompt you for a token rather than a password.

--------
