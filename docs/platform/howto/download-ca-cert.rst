Download a CA certificate
=========================

If your service needs a CA certificate, download it through the DLH `web console <https://console.DLH.io>`_ by accessing the overview page for the specific service, and clicking on the ``Download`` button on the ``CA Certificate`` line.

Or, you can use the ``avn`` :doc:`command-line tool </docs/tools/cli>` with the following command::

  avn service user-creds-download --username <username> <service-name>
