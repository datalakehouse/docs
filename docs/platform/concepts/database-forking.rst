Database forking
================

Fork your Aiven service in order to make a copy of the database. You can use it to create a development copy of your production environment, set up a snapshot to analyze an issue or test an upgrade, or create an instance in a different cloud/geographical location/under a different plan.

When you fork a service, the following items are copied into the new service:

- Configurations
- Databases
- Service users
- Connection pools

.. Warning::
        The service integrations are not copied over to the forked version, and need to be re-established for each new copy. 

You can fork the following Aiven services:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Redis
- Cassandra (Limitation: you cannot fork to a lower amount of nodes)
- Elasticsearch
- InfluxDB
- M3DB
- Grafana

When forking a service with Point in Time Recovery (PITR), you can choose to fork from the latest transaction or select a specific point in the past to fork from.
